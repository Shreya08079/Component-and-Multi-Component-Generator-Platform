# CodeCraft: Component & Multi‚ÄëComponent Generator Platform

> **A stateful, AI-driven micro-frontend playground where authenticated users can iteratively generate, preview, tweak, and export React components‚Äîor entire multi-component pages‚Äîwith all chat history, code edits, and UI state preserved across logins.**

CodeCraft empowers you to:
- **Generate single components or full pages** via conversational AI (LLM-powered, supports text and image prompts)
- **Preview and tweak your work live** in a secure, sandboxed micro-frontend viewport
- **Iterate with chat**: further prompts patch or refine your code, supporting incremental and delta updates
- **Inspect and export**: view syntax-highlighted JSX/TSX and CSS, copy, or download as a ZIP
- **Save, resume, and manage sessions**: all chat, code, and editor state is auto-saved and reloads instantly after login or page refresh
- **Edit interactively**: click any element to open a property editor for size, color, text, border, and more, with two-way binding to code
- **Target elements with chat**: after selecting, prompt the AI to apply style/code changes to just that element

Built with Next.js, React, Express, MongoDB, Redis, and OpenRouter-compatible LLMs (Llama 3/4, Gemini, GPT-4o-mini, etc.), CodeCraft is designed for rapid prototyping, learning, and experimentation with modern component-based UIs.
